## 🔑 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key

Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and generate your free API key.

---

### 2️⃣ Configure the API Key

In `API.js`, add your API key:

```javascript
// Add this near the top of API.js
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
````

Then update the fetch URL:

```javascript
const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&units=metric&appid=${API_KEY}`;
```

---

### 3️⃣ Run the App

Simply open `index1.html` in your favorite web browser.

---

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Enter the city name in the input field.
2. Click the **Get Weather** button.
3. View the city name, temperature, and description.

If the city isn’t found, an error message will be displayed.

---

## ⚠️ Important

🔒 **Do not commit your API key to a public repository.**
💡 For production, consider:

* Using a backend proxy server.
* Hiding your key with environment variables or build tools.

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add background images based on weather conditions.
* Allow for temperature unit switching (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
* Add 5-day forecasts.
